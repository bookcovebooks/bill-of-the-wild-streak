  "description": "On a moonlit hillside at the edge of the wilderness, Bill—a powerful mongrel sheepdog with wolf blood in his veins—stands guard over his master’s flock. Bound by fierce loyalty yet haunted by an inherited hunger for the kill, Bill lives in constant tension between duty and instinct. When danger comes in the night and blood is spilled, his restraint is tested as never before. This quiet, gripping tale explores devotion, trust, and the thin, perilous line between civilization and the wild that still glimmers in a dog’s eyes.",
